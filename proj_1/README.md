# Project 1

## Name: Gautam Ajey Khanapuri
## Email: khanapuri.g@northeastern.edu

I worked alone.

Please note that I joined the course late. Hence, I request you to excuse me for the late submission.

I have not created any URLs or video links for this project.


### Information about my code.
I have used C++17 for the source code.
I used Makefile for development.

Run:
make clean all


This will create two binaries: task1 and task2

task1 corresponds to imgDisplay.cpp
task2 corresponds to vidDisplay.cpp

#### How to use
1) ./task1

The program will ask you to input the file path of the image. Please pass in the absolute file path. And **escape whitespaces**. For example if the name of the image has a space in it, write ' ' as '\ '. 
When you are done viewing the image press any character to close the image and open another image.
Press 'q' or 'Q' to terminate the program.


2) ./task2

This will run the program. You will have to grant permission to the program to use your camera. 
Once the video is visible, you can switch between different modes by using the correct keys. Press 'c' to come back to the normal mode.
To save only the image being displayed, press 's'.
To save all frames involved in creating the displayed frame, press 'S'.
